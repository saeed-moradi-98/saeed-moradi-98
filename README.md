## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm a recent computer science graduate from the University of Manitoba, with hands-on experience in blockchains, distributed systems, privacy-preserving techniques, and so on.
- 🌱 I'm always enthusiastic about solving real-world problems and issues. I have worked in 3 different companies as a sofware engineer, along with two internships I participated about blockchain technologies.
